- **Project 1: Image classification for noisy MNIST dataset** (Your task is to train a good hand-written-digit recognition classifier for the noisy images)
- **Project 2: Machine translation for two "artificial" languages** (Your task is to design and train a good model, which can take texts in the "Input language" as its input, translate them to the corresponding texts in the "Output Language" and output them. (Note: the final output of your code should not include extra tokens such as [start] or [end]))
- **Project 3: Language modeling for an artificial language** (Your task is to build a model such that given a "partial text" in the artificial language, the model can predict the next word)
